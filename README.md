📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes the spread, impact, and management of COVID-19 in India using multiple datasets, including case counts, vaccination records, testing information, demographic details, and state boundaries.
The goal is to provide a visual and data-driven understanding of how the pandemic evolved across different Indian states, age groups, and timelines.

The dashboard helps users track the growth of cases, vaccination progress, testing capacity, and regional variations, enabling better awareness and decision-making.

📌 Key Features
1. National-Level COVID-19 Trends

Daily and cumulative cases

Active, recovered, and deceased trends

Growth rate visualization

2. State-Wise Analysis

Interactive state map

Total confirmed, active, recovered, and death counts

State-level comparison charts

3. Vaccination Dashboard

Dose-1 and Dose-2 progress

State-level vaccination coverage

Trends of vaccination over time

4. Testing & Healthcare Capacity

Total tests conducted

State-wise testing centers (ICMR labs)

Positivity rate trends

5. Demographic Analysis

Age-group distribution of cases

Gender-wise statistics

Individual case details (where available)

📌 Insights From the Dashboard
1. Pandemic Trend Insights

Significant rise in cases during peak waves (First & Second Wave).

Recovery rate improved over time due to increased medical preparedness.

2. State Variations

Maharashtra, Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu consistently showed higher case counts.

Northeastern states showed lower case counts but higher fluctuations during waves.

3. Vaccination Insights

Rapid acceleration after mid-2021 with steady increase in both doses.

States like Kerala and Himachal Pradesh achieved faster vaccination coverage.

4. Testing & Positivity Insights

Increased testing led to better detection and lower positivity percentages later.

States with more ICMR labs showed higher test coverage and earlier detection.

5. Age & Gender Impact

Majority of infections were in the 20–50 age group, indicating working-age population exposure.

Gender distribution slightly skewed towards male cases, as observed globally.
