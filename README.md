## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the spread, impact, and management of COVID-19 in India using multiple datasets, including case counts, vaccination records, testing information, demographic details, and state boundaries.
The goal is to provide a visual and data-driven understanding of how the pandemic evolved across different Indian states, age groups, and timelines.

The dashboard helps users track the growth of cases, vaccination progress, testing capacity, and regional variations, enabling better awareness and decision-making.

## 🔑 Insights from Dashboards
**1. Pandemic Trend Insights**

Significant rise in cases during peak waves (First & Second Wave).

Recovery rate improved over time due to increased medical preparedness.

**2. State Variations**

Maharashtra, Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu consistently showed higher case counts.

Northeastern states showed lower case counts but higher fluctuations during waves.

**3. Vaccination Insights**

Rapid acceleration after mid-2021 with steady increase in both doses.

States like Kerala and Himachal Pradesh achieved faster vaccination coverage.

**4. Testing & Positivity Insights**

Increased testing led to better detection and lower positivity percentages later.

States with more ICMR labs showed higher test coverage and earlier detection.

**5. Age & Gender Impact**

Majority of infections were in the 20–50 age group, indicating working-age population exposure.

Gender distribution slightly skewed towards male cases, as observed globally.
